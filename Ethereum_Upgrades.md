# Ethereum's 5 Major Protocol Upgrades

## 1. The Merge (Completed - September 2022)
### Technical Implementation
- **Consensus Layer Change**
  - Replaced Proof of Work (PoW) with Proof of Stake (PoS)
  - Implemented beacon chain merger with execution layer
  - Introduced validator nodes replacing miners

### Key Components
1. **Beacon Chain**
   - Uses LMD GHOST fork choice rule
   - Implements Casper FFG finality gadget
   - Manages validator registry and staking

2. **Validator Architecture**
   ```typescript
   interface Validator {
     pubkey: string;
     withdrawalCredentials: string;
     effectiveBalance: bigint;
     slashed: boolean;
     activationEligibilityEpoch: number;
     activationEpoch: number;
     exitEpoch: number;
     withdrawableEpoch: number;
   }
   ```

3. **Energy Efficiency**
   - 99.95% reduction in energy consumption
   - Removed GPU mining dependency
   - Reduced hardware requirements

## 2. The Surge (In Progress)
### Technical Implementation
1. **Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844)**
   - Introduces blob-carrying transactions
   - Implements data availability sampling
   - Temporary data storage mechanism

### Key Components
1. **Rollup Architecture**
```typescript
interface RollupBlock {
  stateRoot: string;
  parentHash: string;
  transactions: Transaction[];
  batchProof: ZKProof;
  validityProof: ValidityProof;
}
```

2. **Data Availability**
   - Data sharding implementation
   - Blob space for rollups
   - Sampling-based verification

3. **Scaling Solutions**
   - Target: 100,000+ TPS
   - Optimistic and ZK rollups
   - Data availability layers

## 3. The Verge (Planned)
### Technical Implementation
1. **Verkle Trees**
   - Replaces Merkle Patricia Trees
   - Stateless client support
   - Polynomial commitment scheme

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
interface VerkleNode {
  key: Buffer;
  value: Buffer;
  commitment: PolyCommitment;
  proof: VerkleProof;
}
```

### Key Features
1. **State Management**
   - Reduced node storage requirements
   - Efficient state proofs
   - Improved witness size

2. **Stateless Clients**
   - Block validity without state storage
   - Witness-based verification
   - Reduced hardware requirements

## 4. The Purge (Planned)
### Technical Implementation
1. **State Expiry**
   - Time-based state removal
   - Historical data pruning
   - State rent mechanisms

### Data Management
```typescript
interface StateExpiry {
  lastAccessEpoch: number;
  expiryThreshold: number;
  storageProof: Proof;
  recoveryMechanism: RecoveryPath;
}
```

### Key Components
1. **History Cleanup**
   - Bounded state growth
   - Automated data cleanup
   - Storage optimization

2. **Technical Debt Resolution**
   - Legacy code removal
   - Protocol simplification
   - Storage efficiency improvements

## 5. The Splurge (Planned)
### Technical Implementation
1. **Miscellaneous Upgrades**
   - Account abstraction
   - Enhanced cryptographic primitives
   - Improved EVM capabilities

### Security Enhancements
```typescript
interface SecurityUpgrade {
  proposerCommitments: Commitment[];
  subnetOptimization: SubnetConfig;
  cryptographicPrimitives: CryptoSpec;
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Network Improvements**
   - Single-slot finality
   - Improved P2P protocols
   - Enhanced DOS protection

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Better debugging tools
   - Enhanced testing frameworks
   - Improved documentation

## Technical Principles Across All Upgrades

### 1. Security First
- Formal verification of critical components
- Multiple security audits
- Gradual rollout strategy

### 2. Backwards Compatibility
- Minimal breaking changes
- Legacy support where necessary
- Smooth transition paths

### 3. Scalability Focus
- Horizontal and vertical scaling
- Layer 2 optimization
- Resource efficiency

### 4. Decentralization
- Reduced hardware requirements
- Increased participation possibilities
- Distributed control mechanisms

### 5. Sustainability
- Long-term viability
